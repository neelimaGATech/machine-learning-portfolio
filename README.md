# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio

#### This is the high level overview of all the Data Science and Machine Learning projects I have worked on. For more details about each of these projects, please follow the link and review the Readme document for the individual project. 

#### Technologies Used 
Python, Numpy, Pandas, PyTorch, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn 

#### Projects

1. [Flood Water Segmentation](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/FloodWaterSegmentation)
   
2. [Large Language Model](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/LargeLanguageModel)

In this project, I’ve built a large language model from scratch using the transformer architecture. Each component of the transformer has been manually implemented to provide a clear understanding of how a language model functions. You can follow the code and comments in the Jupyter 
notebooks to explore the inner workings of the model.

3. [Computer Vision Experiments with PyTorch](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/CompVision_Pytorch_Experiments)

In this project, I’ve used the PyTorch library to train a RESNET Neural Network on ImageNet dataset. It covers the basics of how to create a RESNET, pre-process data before training, train and then use a saved RESNET configuration to make predictions on new images. You can follow the code and comments in the Jupyter notebooks to explore the inner workings of the model.

4. [Euro Satellite Image Processing for Land Usage](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/EuroSatelliteDataProcessing)

In this project, I’ve used the PyTorch library to train a RESNET Neural Network on EuroSAT land data for different land usage types. It covers data proeprocessing (tiles and batches) and training and using saved model to do predictions of type of land (forest, water, farm ..) use for making predictions. 

5. [Reinforced Learning](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/reinforced_learning)
6. [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/neelimaGATech/unsupervised_learning)
